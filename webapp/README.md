# Please Note 
 You can view other issue pages (aside from walmartlabs/thorax) if you format the url as follows 
 ## localhost:3000/issues/${organization_name}/${repo_name}
 ### for any valid (organization_name, repo_name)

 I did not handle all edge cases properly, so you will receive an error if you try to visit an invalid org/repo url.
